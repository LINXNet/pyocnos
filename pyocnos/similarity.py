    """
    Algorithm to calculate similarity of two XML elements, described in the
    paper quoted on top of this module.
    Basically:
    if two XML elements have different tag, they are different;
    if they are both leaf nodes, compare their value for similarity;
    if only one of them is leaf node and the other has deeper structure, they
    are different;
    if both of them are not leaf nodes, calculate the similarity based on
    their children elements.

    Two adjustments on top the conference paper:
      * calcuate similarity rather than distance
      * assign a very small similary even two elements are totally different
        different, as long as they share the same tag name.

    The reason for the first adjustment is to solve problem like this, try
    compare this XML element e1
      <snmphost>
        <host>10.1.1.1</host>
        <version>1</version>
      </snmphost>
    with e2
      <snmphost>
        <host>10.2.2.2</host>
        <version>2c</version>
      </snmphost>
    and e3
      <snmphost>
        <host>10.1.1.1</host>
        <version>1</version>
        <udp>1</udp>
      </snmphost>
    Using XML distance as metrics, the distance between e1 and e2 is
    1 + 0 / 2 = 0.5, whilst distance between e1 and e3 is
    0 + 0 + 1 / 3 = 0.3. It concludes e1 and e3 are closer, even from edition
    point of view they should be equivalent (one update and one addition).
    However, if we adjust e3 to add one more distinct children,
    so e4
      <snmphost>
        <host>10.1.1.1</host>
        <version>1</version>
        <udp>1</udp>
        <vrfName>management</vrfName>
      </snmphost>
    The distance between e1 and e4 becomes 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 / 4 = 0.5, which
    seems less sensible; and if we carry one and and one more distince element
    to e4, the distance will become 0.6. Now the algorithm concludes e1 and e2
    is closer. To serve the purpose of measuring two XML elements, i.e.
    creating a diff, such behavior reversal would confuse the end user.
    Using similarity as metrics solves this problem by voiding the accumulation
    of distances among different child elements.

    The reason for the other adjustment, i.e. defining a small similarity to
    describe XML elements with the same tag but different comes from this
    problem, for comparing e1
      <snmp>
        <snmphost>
          <host>10.1.1.1</host>
        </snmphost>
      </snmp>
    and e2
      <snmp>
        <snmphost>
          <host>10.2.2.2</host>
        </snmphost>
      </snmp>
    If we judge they are totally different, the presentation of the diff will
    be deletion of e1 and addition of e2, which is a quite large diff. However
    if we decide they are not totally different, after all they have quite the
    same structure, the diffing can go deeper layer and only compare the host
    element, and thus the diff result would be much clearer.
